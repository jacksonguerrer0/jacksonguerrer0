# WELCOME :)

I’m a Software Developer, and my journey has been all about diving deep into both Frontend (web apps) and Backend (services). Currently, I’m working as a Backend Developer.

Started coding back in 2021, and since then, I've become a total tech enthusiast, always looking to learn and push boundaries. I’m especially curious about AI—if you’ve got any tips, hit me up! I'm a self-taught, open-minded learner, and I love tackling challenges, whether on my own or as part of a team.

Technology fuels my passion, and I believe it can make a real difference in the world.
